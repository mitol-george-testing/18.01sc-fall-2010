Overview
--------

We understand slope as the change in y coordinate divided by the change in x coordinate. Considering change in position over time or change in temperature over distance, we see that the derivative can also be interpreted as a rate of change. If we think of an inaccurate measurement as "changed" from the true value we can apply derivatives to determine the impact of errors on our calculations.
